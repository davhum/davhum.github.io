The manuscript reports fundamental findings that extra-embryonic visceral yolk sac endoderm is critical for NAD de novo synthesis during early organogenesis, and perturbations of this pathway may cause Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder. The supporting evidence is solid. This work will be of interest to developmental biologists.

My contribution to this manuscript involved analysing scRNA-Seq data and preparing figures.
